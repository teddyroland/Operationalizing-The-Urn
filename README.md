# Operationalizing The Urn
This repository supports the blog series "Operationalizing The Urn," which revisits the close reading method theorized by Cleanth Brooks in <em>The Well Wrought Urn</em> as a series of operations performed on literary texts. In particular, this code is used to produce the findings reported in the second post, "Distant Reading a Century of Structure." These findings offer a preliminary test of Brooks's historical claims about literature.

The statistical model developed here receives further exploration in the third post, "Irony (& Paradox & Ambiguity)." This repository includes the lists of <em>initial</em> and <em>final</em> words dicussed there. Further output from the model can be found in the "model" folder.

Neither the underlying corpus (due to copyright) nor the derivative document-term matrix (due to limitations of space) have been made available here. For inquiries regarding the latter, email roland [at] umail [dot] ucsb [dot] edu
